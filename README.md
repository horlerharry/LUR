The Power Auctioneers Network (PAN) is a project designed for solving the challenges of User Pairing and Power Allocation in Multi-Carrier Cooperative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access. Here I have investigated two new game theoretical approaches to handle the resource management in a distributed method to reduce the load on the transmitting base station. This is the performance of all games investigated, for a scenario with 3 Primary Users and 3 Secondary Users where the power of the transmit SNR is increased from 15 to 25 dB.

This project is in-line with the goals of my PhD.
